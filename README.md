# E-commerce System â€“ Fawry Rise Journey Internship Challenge

This project is a Java-based implementation of a simple e-commerce system, developed as part of the **Fawry Full Stack Internship Challenge**. It demonstrates strong object-oriented design principles and robust handling of various business cases, including product expiration, shipping, cart checkout, and customer balance management.
